OVALS: 
  These appear at the top and bottom of the flowchart, and are called terminal symbols.
  The Start terminal symbol marks the program’s starting point, and the End terminal symbol marks the program’s ending point.
  
PARALLELOGRAMS: 
  Used for both input symbols (adding or getting information) and output symbols (displaying or printing information). 

RECTANGLES: 
  These are called processing symbols; use these to perform an action with the inputs or outputs. 

DIAMONDS: 
  These are called decision symbols; use these to evaluate a condition or statement and will branch depending on whether the evaluation is true or false.

CIRCLES: 
  If your flowchart is too large to fit on a single page, you can break the flowchart into parts, and place the parts side-by-side as we did with the pesto recipe. When you do this, you use a connector symbol to connect the pieces of the flowchart. A connector symbol is a small circle with a letter or number written inside it.
